# Ecosystem call for papers

**Contribute to building the trusted knowledge foundation for AI and humanity.**

OriginTrail is inviting researchers and builders to submit proposals and research papers that advance the frontier of decentralized knowledge technologies. The initiative aims to support the development of systems that make AI more explainable, trustworthy, and beneficial to all.

This call will formally launch soon. Until then, we invite interested contributors to join the conversation and prepare for submission.

### Why This Matters

The world is entering a critical phase of digital evolution, where artificial intelligence systems increasingly shape decisions in science, healthcare, finance, and governance. Yet, the trustworthiness, provenance, and interpretability of these systems remain significant challenges.

This Call for Papers is part of a broader effort to address these challenges through:

* Advancing verifiable and explainable AI systems
* Enabling privacy-preserving, decentralized knowledge agents
* Empowering communities to co-create and govern public knowledge infrastructures

All submissions will be published on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), a public infrastructure for trusted knowledge. Discussions will be supported through community calls and asynchronous collaboration tools.

### What We're Looking For

We invite papers and project proposals that explore and advance any of the following (non-exhaustive) areas:

* Privacy-preserving agents using decentralized knowledge graphs (on devices or edge nodes)
* Decentralized data monetization and knowledge marketplaces
* Assessment and signaling of truthfulness using trusted knowledge
* Discoverability and retrieval of knowledge in distributed networks
* Privacy-preserving graph queries and vector search
* Autonomous research agents and decentralized scientific workflows
* Federated learning with decentralized trust
* Applications of graph machine learning and neuro-symbolic reasoning
* Multichain and cross-domain knowledge verification\


We encourage submissions that demonstrate both rigorous research and practical experimentation—especially those that aim to publish, interact with, or expand knowledge on the DKG.

### Who Should Apply

This call is open to individuals and teams with expertise in artificial intelligence, semantic technologies, graph data systems, distributed computing, and related domains. Both academic and industry participants are welcome.

Ideal applicants will have prior experience in:

* Designing or working with knowledge graph systems
* Publishing technical or scientific work
* Building experimental or deployed AI systems

### Funding and Recognition

Top 10 submissions will receive support to further develop and deploy their work with a:

* A total prize pool of 100,000 TRAC tokens
* All accepted papers will be published on the DKG, making them accessible, immutable, and referenceable

Proposals that intend to conduct live experiments, publish structured knowledge, or extend the DKG’s capabilities will be given priority in evaluation.

### Submission and Tools

A new set of tools and infrastructure will accompany the call, including:

* A DKG Research Agent that allows interaction with published papers
* Edge Nodes capable of reading and publishing papers in PDF or Markdown
* A community-driven technical fellowship to support and evaluate proposals

Detailed submission guidelines will be announced shortly.

### Stay Involved
