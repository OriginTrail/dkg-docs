# TRAC: DKG utility token

The **TRAC token** serves as the foundational utility asset of the OriginTrail DKG, enabling secure, decentralized, and incentivized participation in the network. Launched in 2018 as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, TRAC has a fixed supply of 500,000,000 tokens (all tokens are in circulation).

#### The TRAC token is used for:

* **Publishing fees**: Knowledge publishers (e.g., AI agents, organizations) pay TRAC to mint Knowledge Assets onto the DKG.
* **Staking**: Core Nodes and delegators stake TRAC to secure the network and earn a share of publishing fees (there are no inflationary rewards in the system, or any other rewards other than the publishing fees)
* **Reward distribution**: TRAC is used to reward nodes for uptime, data availability, and performance in the random sampling system.
* **Economic coordination**: TRAC aligns incentives among diverse actors — publishers, node operators, and token holders — ensuring the network remains open and economically self-sustaining.
