  Create your first Knowledge Asset on OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph
  using the DKG JavaScript SDK
icon: js

# Quickstart with Node.js

## üöÄ Step 1: Set up your project and install the SDK

### 1.1 Create your project folder

1. Create a new folder on your computer named `OT-DKG-Quickstart`
2. Open the folder in your code editor:
   * **VS Code**: File ‚Üí Open Folder ‚Üí Select `OT-DKG-Quickstart`
   * **Cursor**: File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Select `OT-DKG-Quickstart`

### 1.2 Open a terminal in your project folder

* **VS Code**: Right-click the folder in Explorer ‚Üí "Open in Integrated Terminal"
* **Cursor**: Click the folder ‚Üí "Open Terminal Here"

### 1.3 Initialize project and install SDK

```bash
# Initialize your project
npm init -y

# Install the DKG SDK
npm install dkg.js@latest
```

### 1.4 Set up your private key

1. Create a new file named `.env` in your project root
2. Add your wallet's private key:

```
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note**: Replace `your_private_key_here` with your actual private key. Never share this file or commit it to version control!
{% endhint %}

> **How to get your private key from MetaMask**:
>
> 1. Open MetaMask
> 2. Click the three dots menu
> 3. Select "Account Details"
> 4. Click "Export Private Key"
> 5. Enter your password and copy the key

## üìù Step 2: Publish your first knowledge asset

A Knowledge Asset (KA) is structured data stored on the DKG. Let's create a simple one!

### Example Knowledge Asset

Here's the JSON-LD KA we'll publish



```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "@id": "urn:first-dkg-ka:info:hello-dkg",
  "name": "Hello DKG",
  "description": "My first Knowledge Asset on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph!"
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
üí° Tip: You can customize the `name` and `description` fields with your own content! Make sure to also change the last part of the `@id` (e.g., from "hello-dkg" to "my-asset-name") to keep your asset unique for querying later!
{% endhint %}

### JavaScript implementation

1. Create a new file named `publish_ka.mjs` in your project folder
2. Copy and paste this code, replacing the content part with your custom values if you'd like (as described in the Example Knowledge Asset section above):

```javascript
import DKG from 'dkg.js';
import { BLOCKCHAIN_IDS } from 'dkg.js/constants';
import 'dotenv/config';

const OT_NODE_HOSTNAME = 'https://v6-pegasus-node-02.origin-trail.network';
const OT_NODE_PORT = '8900';

const DkgClient = new DKG({
    endpoint: OT_NODE_HOSTNAME,
    port: OT_NODE_PORT,
    blockchain: {
        name: BLOCKCHAIN_IDS.NEUROWEB_TESTNET,
        privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
    },
    maxNumberOfRetries: 300,
    frequency: 2,
    contentType: 'all',
    nodeApiVersion: '/v1',
});

(async () => {
    const content = {
        public: {
            '@context': 'https://www.schema.org',
            '@id': 'urn:first-dkg-ka:info:hello-dkg',
            '@type': 'CreativeWork',
            'name': 'Hello DKG',  // üéØ Remember this name for querying!
            'description': 'My first Knowledge Asset on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph!'
        },
    };

    console.log('Publishing Knowledge Asset...');
    
    const create_result = await DkgClient.asset.create(content, {
        epochsNum: 2,
        minimumNumberOfFinalizationConfirmations: 3,
        minimumNumberOfNodeReplications: 1,
    });

    console.log('Success! Your Knowledge Asset has been published:');
    console.log(JSON.stringify(create_result, null, 2));
})();
```

3. Run the script by entering the following into the terminal:

```bash
node publish_ka.mjs
```

{% hint style="info" %}
‚è≥ **Note**: Publishing might take 30-60 seconds. You'll see a success message with details about your KA!
{% endhint %}

## üîç Step 3: Query & Retrieve Your Knowledge Asset

Now let's retrieve your published Knowledge Asset using a SPARQL query.

1. Create a new file in your project folder named `query_ka.mjs` , paste in the code below, and update the query name if you changed the name of the KA when creating it:

```javascript
import DKG from 'dkg.js';
import { BLOCKCHAIN_IDS } from 'dkg.js/constants';
import 'dotenv/config';

const OT_NODE_HOSTNAME = 'https://v6-pegasus-node-02.origin-trail.network';
const OT_NODE_PORT = '8900';

const DkgClient = new DKG({
    endpoint: OT_NODE_HOSTNAME,
    port: OT_NODE_PORT,
    blockchain: {
        name: BLOCKCHAIN_IDS.NEUROWEB_TESTNET,
        privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
    },
    maxNumberOfRetries: 300,
    frequency: 2,
    contentType: 'all',
    nodeApiVersion: '/v1',
});

// ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Update "hello dkg" if you changed the name when publishing!
const query = `
    PREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>
    SELECT ?s ?name ?description
    WHERE {
        ?s schema:name ?name ;
           schema:description ?description .
        FILTER(LCASE(?name) = "hello dkg")
    }
`;

(async () => {
    console.log('Querying for your Knowledge Asset...');
    
    try {
        const queryResult = await DkgClient.graph.query(query,"SELECT");
        console.log('Found your Knowledge Asset!');
        console.log(JSON.stringify(queryResult, null, 2));
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error querying the asset:", error);
        console.log("Tip: Make sure the name in your query matches the name you used when publishing!");
    }
})();
```

2. Run the query by entering the following into your terminal:&#x20;

```bash
node query_ka.mjs
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Query Troubleshooting

If your query returns no results:

1. **Check the name**: Ensure the name in your SPARQL query exactly matches what you published
2. **Wait a moment**: Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the KA to be fully indexed
3. **Verify publication**: Check that your publish script completed successfully

Example: If you changed the name to "My Custom KA", update your query:

```sparql
FILTER(LCASE(?name) = "my custom ka")
```

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've successfully:

* Published your first Knowledge Asset to the DKG
* Created a verifiable, ownable asset that you control
* Retrieved it using a SPARQL query
* Learned the basics of the OriginTrail SDK

Your **Knowledge Asset now lives on the DKG**, where it's:

* **Owned by you -** secured by your wallet
* **Verifiable -** anyone can cryptographically verify you as the publisher
* **Discoverable -** can be found by anyone while you maintain ownership

## üöÄ What's Next?

Now that you've mastered the basics, here's what comes next.

[**Explore the ChatDKG builder toolkit**](../chatdkg-builder-toolkit/)

Everything you need to build with the DKG: publish and query knowledge, deploy autonomous AI agents, and launch decentralized knowledge ecosystems with paranets‚Äîall from a unified toolkit.

[**Build with your Edge Node**](../dkg-edge-node/)

Take control of your stack: deploy agents, paranets, and private Knowledge Assets on your own infrastructure‚Äîfully customizable and privacy-first.



You‚Äôre now on the path to building a **semantic, decentralized, and AI-ready knowledge ecosystem!**
