# Running DKG nodes

The OriginTrail Decentralized Network is a permissionless system that hosts the Decentralized Knowledge Graph and is ran by the OriginTrail community. **Anyone, anywhere can run an OriginTrail DKG node -** you require no permission, and you can even expand node functionalities as it is completely open source software.&#x20;

There are two ways to run a DKG node:

1. as a **gateway node**, which enables access to the DKG (publishing and querying knowledge assets)
2. as a **full (hosting) node**, which apart from providing access, also hosts the DKG state

For a DKG node to be eligible to host a portion of the DKG and receive publishing fees (to be a hosting node), it has to accumulate a **minimum of 50 000 TRAC** tokens as stake in the network on a particular blockchain. Network stake provides the economic security layer and can be provided by anyone owning TRAC tokens by the notion of "delegated staking". &#x20;

However running a DKG node requires some degree of technical knowledge, so you are advised to carefully consider all of the relevant implications of doing so. In the following pages you will get detailed instructions on how to setup a DKG node, and we encourage you to seek assistance if needed within the [OriginTrail community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FCgYk2S) server

{% hint style="info" %}
These setup instructions are a "Work in progress" and are subject to change, and the core developers aim to keep it up to date at all times. However if you notice an issue during installation, we ask for you to please report the issue on our official [Github repo](https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node) or [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/FCgYk2S).
