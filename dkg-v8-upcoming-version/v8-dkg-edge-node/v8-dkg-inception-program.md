# V8 DKG Inception program

Join the OriginTrail community in building the internet scale DKG V8 and earn TRAC rewards. Deploy neuro-symbolic, privacy-enabled AI on the DKG across different edge devices, providing exciting customization options.

OriginTrail is providing a pool of 750k TRAC tokens for eligible contributors. These tokens will be awarded to those who successfully build functioning applications and showcase valuable knowledge creation. The grant must then be used for mainnet publishing once your apps are prepared.

Apply to showcase your work on the testnet & compete for the share of the 750k TRAC for builders.
