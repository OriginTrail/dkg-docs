# Run a V8 Core Node on testnet

The OriginTrail V8 network is comprised of two types of DKG nodes - **Core Nodes**, which form the DKG network core and host the DKG, and **Edge Nodes,** which run on edge devices and connect to the network core.

The following pages will guide you through the process of setting up a V8 Core Node on the V8 incentivized testnet. DKG Core Nodes require a Linux server with high uptime, as they are intended to run constantly to support the network. Before installing the V8 DKG Core Node, it's essential to complete a few key steps, such as acquiring tokens, preparing node keys, obtaining blockchain RPC endpoints, and similar.&#x20;

The setup process should usually last between 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your proficiency level. In case you have trouble or questions at any point, join the dedicated[ OriginTrail #v8-discussion Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/WCnDQArdzQ) and the OriginTrail community will gladly assist.
