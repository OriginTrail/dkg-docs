# DKG toolkit

The DKG builder toolkit is your foundation for building trusted AI—from agents that can remember, reason, and collaborate, to entire ecosystems of shared intelligence. With powerful tools for structuring, creating, and retrieving knowledge on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph, you can build AI applications that are transparent and grounded in verifiable knowledge. Whether you're deploying AI agents, connecting knowledge streams, or launching collaborative paranets, the toolkit is your gateway to the next generation of trusted and verifiable AI solutions.

To take your DKG-powered builds even further, combine the DKG builder toolkit with your own [Edge Node](../dkg-edge-node/) for full control and flexibility across your DKG stack.
