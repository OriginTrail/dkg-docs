# Contribute

## Contribution Guidelines

We’d love for you to contribute to our source code and to make OT protocol better than it is today! Here are the guidelines we’d like you to follow.

If you’re new to OT node development, there are guides in this wiki for getting your dev environment set up. Get to know the commit process with something small like a bug fix. If you’re not sure where to start post a message on the Discord \#general channel.

Once you’ve got your feet under you then you can start working on larger features. For anything more than a bug fix, it probably makes sense to coordinate through the Discord, since it’s possible someone else is working on the same thing.

Please make descriptive commit messages.

The following checklist is worked through for every commit:

* Check out and try the changeset.
* Ensure that the code follows the language coding conventions.
* Ensure that the code is well designed and architected.

## Pull Requests

If you report an issue, we’d love to see a pull request attached. Please keep in mind that your commit may end up getting modified. Sometimes we’ll make the change ourselves, but often we’ll just let you know what needs to happen and help you fix it up yourself.

## Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the OT Node project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of our channels \(GitHub, Discord, Twitter, etc.\) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the OT Node project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us.

## Questions, Bugs, Features

### Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You’ve got much better chances of getting your question answered on Discord.

### Found an Issue or Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our \[GitHub Repository\]\[github\]. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

### Missing a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our \[GitHub Repository\]\[github-issues\].

If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an \[GitHub issue\]\[github-issues\] that clearly outlines the changes and benefits of the feature.
* **Small Changes** can directly be crafted and submitted to the \[GitHub Repository\]\[github\] as a Pull Request. See the section about Pull Request Submission Guidelines, and for detailed information the \[core development documentation\]\[developers\].

### Want a Doc Fix?

Should you have a suggestion for the documentation, you can open an issue and outline the problem or improvement you have - however, creating the doc fix yourself is much better!

If you want to help improve the docs, it’s a good idea to let others know what you’re working on to minimize duplication of effort. Create a new issue \(or comment on a related existing one\) to let others know what you’re working on.

If you’re making a small change \(typo, phrasing\) don’t worry about filing an issue first. Use the friendly blue “Improve this doc” button at the top right of the doc page to fork the repository in-place and make a quick change on the fly. The commit message is preformatted to the right type and scope, so you only have to add the description.

For large fixes, please build and test the documentation before submitting the PR to be sure you haven’t accidentally introduced any layout or formatting issues.
