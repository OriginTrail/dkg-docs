# Public nodes

If you do not already have a DKG node set up, you can use a public node that the OriginTrail team set up so that everyone has an easy way to interact with the DKG.

There's one public node available for the mainnet and one for the testnet:

* **Mainnet public node:** [https://positron.origin-trail.network](https://positron.origin-trail.network/)
* **Testnet public nodes :** [https://v6-pegasus-node-02.origin-trail.network](https://v6-pegasus-node-02.origin-trail.network) and [https://v6-pegasus-node-03.origin-trail.network](https://v6-pegasus-node-02.origin-trail.network)

All blockchains are supported on each of the nodes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mainnet is the live blockchain for real transactions, while testnet is a risk-free testing environment.
