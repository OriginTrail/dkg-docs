# DKG v6 node - setup instructions

{% hint style="info" %}
These setup instructions for DKGv6 are "Work in progress" and are subject to change. The development team expects to introduce improvements as well as a more automated process of setting up the DKGv6 node in the future.
{% endhint %}

## There are 2 ways to setup a **v6** **testnet** node: <a href="#docs-internal-guid-e057adbf-7fff-9a68-2579-1fe11935388b" id="docs-internal-guid-e057adbf-7fff-9a68-2579-1fe11935388b"></a>

1. [Automated setup instructions for Ubuntu and Arch Linux](setup-instructions-dockerless.md) (Dockerless)
2. Directly on a cloud provider supporting OriginTrail, such as on the [**DigitalOcean Marketplace**](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/origintrail-node)



{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT: These instructions are not intended for migrating your current v5 node to v6. Attempting this will most likely break your v5 node at this point. You should only use these instructions in order to setup a fresh OriginTrail v6 testnet node.**
