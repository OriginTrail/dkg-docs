## ü§∫ Hackathon project challenge ideas

### 1. Social and influencer agents

**Description:** Develop agents to analyze, monitor, and enhance social media influence or content. These agents could provide insights on audience engagement, detect trends, or suggest strategies for content optimization.\
\
**Example use of DKG:** Leverage the OriginTrail DKG's advanced neuro-symbolic capabilities for robust knowledge retrieval, enabling cross-platform connectivity and context-aware insights. Connect and analyze influencer data as knowledge asset graphs (e.g., engagement metrics and content performance) for enhanced interpretability and prediction-making..

### 2. Agent infrastructure

**Description:** Create a launchpad or foundational frameworks to enable the development and deployment of agents that use the DKG (via gateway or DKG Edge Nodes) as a decentralized memory system. These tools could simplify agent creation and ensure interoperability across different platforms.\
\
**Example use of DKG:** Utilize the DKG as a shared neuro-symbolic repository where agents store their memories, data, and operational states. Its advanced connectivity and context-aware data modeling ensure resilience, scalability, and collaborative ecosystems. This approach allows agents to retrieve and link complex knowledge assets seamlessly, fostering efficient decentralized workflows.

### 3. DKG AI Agents

**Description:** Build agents that offer seamless interactions with the DKG, making it simple to create, query, and manage decentralized knowledge assets. These agents would abstract the complexities of DKG operations, allowing users to deploy and manage their Core and Edge nodes, create knowledge assets, and retrieve data effortlessly.\
\
**Example use of DKG:** Enable agents to leverage the neuro-symbolic strengths of the DKG to automate complex tasks like node management, asset creation, and data querying. With its advanced knowledge representation and inferencing capabilities, the DKG empowers agents to retrieve and synthesize meaningful insights while maintaining decentralized data integrity and transparency.

### 4. Trading agents

**Description:** Develop agents for autonomous trading in financial markets, leveraging the DKG for data integrity and transparency. These agents can analyze market trends, execute trades, and manage portfolios.\
\
**Example use of DKG:** Use the DKG's neuro-symbolic features to store and interlink historical trading data, market signals, and strategy insights. By enabling advanced connectivity and context-aware retrieval, the DKG facilitates tamper-proof, trusted data for informed decision-making. Its decentralized structure ensures a collaborative and transparent environment for autonomous trading agents, while enabling privacy via Edge nodes.

### 5. Agent swarms

**Description:** Develop coordinated groups of decentralized agents (swarms) that can collaborate to achieve complex goals, such as large-scale data aggregation, social media trend analysis, or interacting in some interesting ways between them, such as spawning new agents themselves etc. These agents could work together autonomously, leveraging distributed intelligence and dynamic task allocation.

**Example use of DKG:** Use the DKG to enable seamless communication and synchronization between agents in the swarm, leveraging its advanced neuro-symbolic capabilities for context-aware decision-making and knowledge sharing. For example, in Web3, agent swarms can analyze token distribution patterns, monitor governance proposal activity, and assess the health of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) by interlinking blockchain activity with community metrics. On social media, swarms can track trending hashtags, analyze cross-platform content virality, and identify influencer collaborations. The DKG ensures these operations remain decentralized, transparent, and resistant to manipulation, providing a trustworthy framework for swarm-based intelligence.

### 6. Meme agents

**Description:** Build agents dedicated to promoting OriginTrail and the DKG through viral content such as memes. These agents could generate and share memes on platforms like Twitter and incentivize users based on engagement metrics.\
\
**Example use of DKG:** Utilize the DKG to store and interconnect the most popular memes with cultural and temporal trends, creating a decentralized, contextually enriched archive of viral content. The DKG's neuro-symbolic strengths facilitate the analysis of meme engagement patterns, enabling incentivization mechanisms rooted in verified, decentralized interaction metrics, promoting community-driven content creation and trust.

### 7. Wildcard

Build whatever you think is cool with Agents and the OriginTrail DKG to impress the jury. Anything goes - from graph reasoning, and agent swarms, token launching, to custom Edge Node integrations for privately run, local agents. Review the judging criteria to guide you.

## üèÜ Prizes

The prizes are designed to help teams bring their agents to life and move them from MVPs to actual products on the DKG. The rewards are structured as follows:

* First Place: **$5,000 in total value** (50% in TRAC, 50% in USDC)
* Second Place: **$2,500 in total value** (50% in TRAC, 50% in USDC)
* Third Place: **$1,000 in total value** (50% in TRAC, 50% in USDC)

{% hint style="info" %}
TRAC rewards are intended to cover the operational cost of your agent on the DKG and will be distributed to your agent's DKG funding contract.

To ensure the funds are used to launch and support the agents, the winners‚Äô wallet addresses will be publicly shared. This approach encourages transparency and underscores the commitment to turning ideas into actionable, impactful solutions.
