# V8 Incentivised Testnet - Measure, Manage, Master

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As with former updates, the launch of the new version 8 of OriginTrail DKG is a joint effort of the OriginTrail community, driven by **an incentivised testnet** system. **The goal of the V8 incentivised testnet is to ensure security, scalability and usability for all ecosystem participants in a joint test environment, before releasing the new version to the DKG mainnet.**&#x20;

With the incentivised testnet, we will co-develop the V8 technological components, constantly measuring performance of individual services, testing the new features and scalability improvements, improving user and developer experience and ultimately reaching maturity for a production release on the mainnet. As always, development is done in an open source manner, however avoiding the usual "tragedy of the commons" of open source development by **incentivising all eligible contributors with a total incentive pool of 1 000 000 TRAC tokens.**

There following four categories of contributions and their incentive pools are indicated below.

| Incentivised Activity                              | Required technical level | Reward Budget |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Staking & UI testing                               | Low                      | 50 000 TRAC   |
| Running core nodes                                 | Medium                   | 100 000 TRAC  |
| Bug submissions & Code contributions               | Medium                   | 100 000 TRAC  |
| Building Paranets (inception program for Builders) | High                     | 750 000 TRAC  |

{% hint style="info" %}
Incentivised testnet rewards are subject to the [V8 terms and conditions](https://dkg-v8-incentivised-testnet.origintrail.io/terms-and-conditions)
{% endhint %}

The V8 incentivised testnet will go through a "3 layer launch", each layer introducing new functionality.

### 1. Core infrastructure Layer:  V8 core nodes

In the first layer the core network infrastructure is established running the new V8 core nodes, which form the backbone of the DKG network. As features such as batch minting Knowledge Assets, random sampling and others are gradually rolled out on the network, the core nodes will **generate useful telemetry data on the V8 testnet operation,** which will be sent to the core development team and for which the community will be incentivised.

Each node contribution will be assigned a **score**, which is based on the activity of each node. Simply put, the more "a core node is being used", the more telemetry data it will generate, and the higher the node score. The most "rewarding" operation is publishing Knowledge Assets, which triggers the most activity on the network.

### 2. Security Layer: V8 staking (coming soon)

Once the core infrastructure is established, we will proceed with the security layer features deployment and testing, including the new Staking UI. Once live, you will be able to contribute by testing out the system and be eligible for rewards for your on-chain activity.

### 3. AI Layer: V8 edge nodes (coming soon)

The final layer will introduce DKG V8 Edge Nodes, designed to run neuro-symbolic, privacy enabled AI on the DKG on various edge devices, with high customizability for builders. The V8 Edge Nodes are currently being tested by the OriginTrail core developers in various environments and are to enable easy creation of Knowledge Assets at scale, creating DRAG applications, fine-tuning AI models based on DKG data, all through a modular architecture fully customizable by builders.
