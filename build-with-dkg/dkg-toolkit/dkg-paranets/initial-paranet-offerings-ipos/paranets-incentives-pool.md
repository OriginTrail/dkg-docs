The **incentives pool** serves to encourage key participants in the paranet ecosystem to perform essential tasks that support its operation. Here's a breakdown of who receives rewards and for what:

1. **Knowledge miners**:
   * Receive rewards for **publishing valuable data and knowledge** to the paranet.
   * Their contributions help grow and maintain the paranet's database and ensure it remains relevant.
2. **Voters**:
   * Receive rewards for **supporting or voting on proposals related** to the paranet.
   * Their participation ensures that decisions regarding the paranet's direction are made democratically and align with the community's interests.
3. **Operators** (paranet creators and maintainers):
   * Paranet operators who **create and maintain the paranet** are rewarded for ensuring the paranet runs smoothly.
   * They are responsible for overseeing its operations, managing resources, and ensuring its success.
