# V8 DKG Core node

DKG Core Nodes form the backbone of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), hosting the public network and ensuring its security and high availability. These nodes are incentivized to maintain uptime and play a crucial role in the network's stability and functionality.

### What Are DKG Core Nodes?

* Core Nodes are essential for providing consistent and reliable access to the DKG. They are designed with incentives to maintain high uptime, ensuring the network remains stable and dependable.
* **Full node:** Full participation as a Core Node requires a minimum stake of 50,000 TRAC tokens. Nodes with larger stakes are rewarded with increased chances of earning network rewards, making staking an integral part of the Core Node ecosystem.
* **Gateway Nodes:** In addition to their role in network security, Core Nodes can serve as Gateway Nodes, specializing in publishing data to the DKG. Nodes with higher publishing activity have an enhanced opportunity to earn rewards, encouraging active contributions.

Core Nodes offer services to the network for a fee. These fees are globally determined through a pricing mechanism that considers the individual asks of each node. Nodes that set competitive fees (or appear less “greedy”) are prioritized, improving their chances of earning rewards.

By balancing staking incentives, publishing capabilities, and fair pricing mechanisms, DKG Core Nodes foster a robust and equitable ecosystem that supports the growth and reliability of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

## Good to know before proceeding:

To run a v8 DKG Core node, you don’t need in-depth knowledge of blockchain or knowledge graphs. If you are comfortable with:

* Navigating through directories and using basic Linux commands (e.g., `cd`, `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `nano/vi`)
* Updating files and configurations
* Understanding and using blockchain wallets
* Basic log monitoring and troubleshooting (e.g., `tail`, `grep`, `less`)
* Setting up and managing firewalls (e.g., `ufw`, `iptables`)

you should be quite ready to operate a DKG Core node effectively. The best way to be sure though, is to try it on the testnet :). To do so, proceed to the next page.
