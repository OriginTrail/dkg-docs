# Step-by-step staking

Welcome to the step-by-step TRAC Delegated staking guide! First lets start with some prerequisites

Prerequisites:

1. You need to have some TRAC tokens to delegate
2. To decide which blockchain you want to stake on (the DKG supports multiple blockchains)
3. Bridge your TRAC to that blockchain
4. Have some gas fee tokens (e.g. NEURO on Neuroweb, ETH on Base etc)

_**Note:** If you are staking on Neuroweb, please make sure that you update both **"Max base fee"** and "**Priority fee**" to **0.00000001** before signing transactions (see image below)._

### **TRAC Staking using the Staking Dashboard:**

Once you have confirmed that you have both gas tokens and TRAC tokens available , you can proceed to the Staking Dashboard at [https://staking.origintrail.io/](https://staking.origintrail.io/) and follow the steps below:\


**Step 1:** Click on the **'Connect Wallet'** button in the top right corner of the navigation bar and follow the prompts to connect your wallet to the interface.

**Step 2:** Make sure you have selected the right blockchain in your wallet.&#x20;

**Step 3:** The Staking Dashboard shows a list of all the Core nodes hosting the DKG - this table shows all kinds of information, such as the node name, which blockchain its connected to, how much stake does a node have, it's ask, it's operator fee, reward statistics and other. **To delegate your TRAC tokens, you need to pick one or more nodes you believe are going to perform best for the network (on the basis of criteria explained on the Delegated staking page) and which has enough "room" to take TRAC (meaning less than 2M TRAC already staked, 2M being the maximum amount of TRAC per one node)**\

**Step 4:** Once you click on a Core node, a staking pop-up opens with the option to delegate or withdraw TRAC tokens from the node. Proceed by pressing the 'Delegate' button

**Step 5:** Enter the amount of TRAC you would like to delegate and press the Delegate TRAC button. The delegation process will require two transactions: one to increase the allowance and another to confirm the contract interaction.

**Step 6:** To confirm that the process was successful, check your TRAC delegation by going to the 'My Delegations' tab above the table with the nodes and verifying that your delegation is listed there. Additionally, ensure that the stake amount on the node has increased following the successful delegation.
