# Running a gateway node

**OriginTrail gateway node** can be used for building applications that interface with the OriginTrail Decentralized Network and gateway node being a dependency (access point to a network) for the use of the OriginTrail SDK.

Running a gateway node is not the same as running a **full (DKG hosting) node** and does not require 50000 TRAC tokens to be posted as stake collateral so if you are looking to build applications leveraging [knowledge assets](https://origintrail.io/products/knowledge-assets) on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), having a gateway node is a place to start.

More information on the OriginTrail SDK libraries can be found [here](https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph-layer-2/dkg-sdk/dkg-v6-js-client).
