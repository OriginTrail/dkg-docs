The core developers released the [**automated development environment setup**](automated-setup-with-the-installer.md) and would **love to hear your feedback** on the installation process. Join the discussion in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/xCaY7hvNwD) _#_&#xD83D;&#xDC77;_&#x62;uilders-hub_ channel!

This guide will walk you through the process of importing a JSON file (example for a movie), transforming it into a JSON-LD format that is compatible with a graph structure using the Knowledge Mining service. Once processed, the data is published to the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) via the Edge Node API. Additionally, a simple DRAG is used to retrieve the movie data and answer basic queries about the film.

To set up the DKG Edge Node in your local environment, you can choose between the following two options:
