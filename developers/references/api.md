# API reference

## Introduction to API

The purpose of this API is to allow data operations on a single node you trust, in order to control the data flow via API routes. For example, importing a single data file into a node’s database, replicating the data on the network or reading it from the node.

Detailed Api routes can be found at this [link](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/TraceLabs/ot-node-api/v2.1) .
