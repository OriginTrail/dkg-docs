# Knowledge Mining and dRAG examples

This page features real-world open-source examples of various dRAG and Knowledge Mining implementations. You can replace the dRAG and Knowledge Mining repositories in your Edge Node setup with these examples if you want to try them out.&#x20;

**DeSci Knowledge Mining:** [Github](https://github.com/brkagithub/desci-knowledge-mining)

This repository contains a pipeline for converting scientific papers (PDFs) into JSON-LD format for ingestion into the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). The pipeline extracts structured knowledge from papers using NLP and LLMs, with a focus on neuroscience papers.

**DeSci dRAG**: [Github](https://github.com/OriginTrail/desci-drag)

This repository provides an API for natural-language querying the Decentralized Science Knowledge Graph using a combination of LLM-powered SPARQL queries and vector similarity search.
