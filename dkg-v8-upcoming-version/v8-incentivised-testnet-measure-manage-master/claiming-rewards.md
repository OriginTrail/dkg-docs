# Claiming Rewards

## Core node testing incentives

The Core Node incentivised testnet stage has completed on Friday, November 8 2024 at 23:59 CET and reward collection will be available from Thursday, November 14 2024.

<mark style="color:orange;">**Keep in mind that the deadline for submitting the reward claiming form is December 15th, 2024.**</mark>\


1. Check if your node is in the scoreboard at [https://dkg-v8-incentivised-testnet.origintrail.io/](https://dkg-v8-incentivised-testnet.origintrail.io/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Only nodes which earned more than or equal to **1 TRAC** are eligible for claiming the reward.
{% endhint %}

2. Click 'Claim Rewards' button or go directly to [Claim Rewards page](https://dkg-v8-incentivised-testnet.origintrail.io/claim-rewards)
3. Enter your data. All the fields labeled with **\*** are **mandatory**. This data is required for **legal** purposes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Providing incomplete data or misinformation may disqualify you from receiving rewards.
{% endhint %}

4. Connect your wallet by clicking the 'Connect Wallet' button. You will need to use your V8 Testnet Node's **operational** wallet, since this is the only way for us to verify that you are the node owner.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to have at least one wallet (browser extension) installed and an operational key of your node loaded in that wallet.
{% endhint %}

5. By clicking on 'Submit' button you will first be prompted to sign a message using the node operational wallet you selected. After signing the message, form will be submitted. If submitting the form fails you will get an error message in red, below the submit button.
6. If the form is successfully submitted, you will be presented with this screen confirming that your entry was submitted:

7. The core development team will periodically review the submissions and after verifying the information distribute rewards to the same node operational key you have used. Please be patient as this period can take us up to 7 business days.
