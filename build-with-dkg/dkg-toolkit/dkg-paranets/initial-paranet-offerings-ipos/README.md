# Initial Paranet Offerings (IPOs)

Initial Paranet Offerings (IPO) are introduced as **a means of a public launch of a paranet, with a Knowledge Asset that is Paranet Profile and accompanying incentivization structure proposed and voted upon via the NeuroWeb governance mechanism**.&#x20;

Each IPO is structured as an initial proposal and an initial set of **knowledge collections (collections of Knowledge Assets)** published, along with an incentivization structure set forth by a paranet operator that proposes how the incentives will be split across three groups:

1. IPO operator
2. Knowledge miners
3. Voters—NEURO holders who participated in supporting the creation of an IPO through NeuroWeb governance.

The paranets feature is initially rolled out on the NeuroWeb blockchain. Other DKG-enabled blockchains will follow.

To launch your Initial Paranet Offering, you are expected to:

1. **Share your initial AI paranet idea publicly** with the knowledge miner community (e.g., in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3BrQDvHpdc) paranets channel)
2. **Specify your paranet** using the provided [IPO template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzKpH_ex-U8mxh-IgwTjijEe3n6vwRVAhG599siapQQ/edit#heading=h.61lymw4v18qp) to prepare it for the NeuroWeb governance proposal. Request a custom Discord channel creation for your paranet via the [#paranets](https://discord.gg/wtC73bqj3c) channel.&#x20;
3. Introduce your paranet topic, knowledge assets, and AI services to the community. To ensure the required community support, we recommend sharing your proposal widely:
   * Sharing it on X
   * Posting on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qRc4xHpFnN)&#x20;
   * Sending to [Telegram](https://t.me/origintrail)&#x20;
4. Before launching the governance vote, [**register your paranet**](../building-with-dkg-paranets.md) and instantiate the _ParanetIncentivesPool_ and _ParanetIncentivesPoolStorage_ smart contracts via the _ParanetIncentivesPoolFactory_ contract.&#x20;
5. **Launch the NeuroWeb Governance Proposal for your paranet**. General instructions for submitting governance proposals are available [here](https://docs.neuroweb.ai/on-chain-governance/submit-a-governance-proposal).
6. Once your paranet idea is supported (voted Aye by a majority vote of the NeuroWeb community), proceed with activating your paranet and knowledge mining
