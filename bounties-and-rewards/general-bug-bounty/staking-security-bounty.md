# Staking security bounty

As a part of the DKG V8 mainnet launch, a 100k TRAC staking security bounty will be awarded to test the staking system in a real economic environment.

The new, improved staking system includes:

* The new [Staking Dashboard](https://staking.origintrail.io/)
* The updated [smart contracts](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-evm-module/)

To be eligible, users need to:

* Stake TRAC on the mainnet and test the upgraded V8 Staking Dashboard between Dec 27, 17:00 CET, and January 10, 17:00 CET.
* Register for claiming the reward from January 10, 17:00 CET, to January 16, 17:00 CET, on [the designated reward claiming interface](https://dkg-v8-incentivised-testnet.origintrail.io/claim-rewards). Registration includes submitting KYC data for the purposes of reward distribution and qualitative feedback on the usage of the staking interface.

The total reward amount will be distributed pro rata among eligible participants according to the size of the stake they contributed during that period.
