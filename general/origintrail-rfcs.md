# OriginTrail RFCs

The OriginTrail development is transparent and being guided by public debate through the Trace Alliance working groups, as well as through technical discussions within the community through the technical **Requests for Comments (OT-RFCs)**.&#x20;

The RFCs have formerly been part of the official documentation and have moved to [this repository](https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository) from OT-RFC-07 on October 12th 2020.

### The RFC lifecycle

There are three stages for an OT-RFC, easily visible in [the RFC Repository Kanban](https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/projects/1).

* DRAFT stage: the RFC is associated DRAFT status in the period of writing and collaborating on the RFC. Once the discussions are completed the RFC moves to Accepted stage
* ACCEPTED stage: The accepted RFCs are to be implemented by the OriginTrail developers, serving as technical specification
* FINAL stage: Once RFCs have been implemented and merged into the codebase, they are considered FINAL

#### The RFC rules & best practices

* RFCs move to the “Accepted” stage by the core developers, after discussions with relevant Trace Alliance working group task forces and the community
* A **“last call”** can be issued for an RFC which is close to moving out of the draft stage to notify the community to provide the final feedback (about a week before acceptance)&#x20;
* Moving the RFC to “Final” stage is performed by developers, responsible to indicate the specific client release that has implemented the RFC
* All RFC related discussions should be directed to the dedicated [RFC issues](https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues) page to promote a constructive, structured and long-term debate on the RFC, avoiding less structured channels such as chat rooms and social media.

The RFC Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository).

### Can I contribute to RFCs?

Absolutely! You can propose your own RFCs or comment and provide feedback on the existing ones in the pipeline. The OriginTrail community welcomes inputs and will greatly appreciate any improvement proposals!
