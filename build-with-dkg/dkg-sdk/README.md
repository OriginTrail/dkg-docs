# DKG SDK

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/4oi_0hJmxcY" %}

The OriginTrail SDKs are client libraries for your applications, used to interact and connect with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

From an architectural standpoint, the SDK libraries are application interfaces into the DKG, enabling you to create and manage **Knowledge Assets** through your apps, as well as perform network queries (such as search, or SPARQL queries), as illustrated below.&#x20;

The OriginTrail SDK currently comes in two forms:

* Javascript SDK - [**dkg.js**](dkg-v8-js-client/)&#x20;
* Python SDK - [**dkg.py**](dkg-v8-py-client/)**.**&#x20;

SDKs for other programming languages would be welcome contributions to the project. The core development team is also considering including them in the roadmap.
