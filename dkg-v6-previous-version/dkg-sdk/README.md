# DKG SDK

The OriginTrail SDKs are client libraries for your applications, used to interact and connect with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

From an architectural standpoint, the SDK libraries are application interfaces into the DKG, enabling you to create and manage **Knowledge Assets** through your apps, as well as perform network queries (such as search, or SPARQL queries), as illustrated below.&#x20;

The OriginTrail SDK libraries are being built in various languages by the team and the community, as listed below:

* [**dkg.js**](dkg-v6-js-client/) -Javascript client (if you are looking for the v5 client, you can find it [here](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-client))
* [**dkg.py**](dkg-v6-py-client/) - Python client
* **dkg.php** - PHP client (coming soon)
* **dkg.rs** - Rust client (coming soon)
* **dkg.go** - Go client (coming soon)
* **dkg.java** - Java client (coming soon)
* **dkg.net** - .NET client (coming soon)
