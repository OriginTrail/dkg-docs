# What's new with OriginTrail V8

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/DKG V8 docs.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) V6 has been battle-tested in real-world applications increasingly used by an ecosystem of organizations and government-supported initiatives. To date, no decentralized system has scaled in the production environment the way DKG V6 has. However, the current capacity of DKG reached its limits to support the growing usage requirements, prompting a transition to the DKG V8, evolved to tackle the scale at which AI is consumed in any environment.

Data has been growing exponentially for decades, with AI driving further growth acceleration — according to the latest estimates, [402.74 million terabytes of data are created each day](https://www.techbusinessnews.com.au/blog/402-74-million-terrabytes-of-data-is-created-every-day/). This trend is increasingly visible in the rising demand for additional DKG capacity, driven by data-intensive industry deployments in aerospace, manufacturing, railways, consumer goods, construction, and new solutions encompassing content from some of the most searched-for websites, fueling DKG growth.

Version 8 of the DKG has therefore been designed **with major scalability improvements at multiple levels**, with a prototyped implementation tested in collaboration with partners from the sectors mentioned above.

The major advancement that DKG V8 is making is in expanding the OriginTrail ecosystem’s product suite to 3 key products:

* **DKG Core Node V8** — highly scalable network nodes forming the network core, persisting the public replicated DKG
* **DKG Edge Node V8** — user-friendly node applications tailored to edge devices (phones, laptops, etc.)
* **ChatDKG V8** — the launchpad for creating neuro-symbolic AI solutions with the DKG

The newcomer in the product suite is the **DKG Edge Node** — a new type of DKG node enabling the OriginTrail ecosystem to tackle the global challenges described above. As the name suggests, DKG Edge Nodes can operate on Internet edge devices. Devices such as personal computers, mobile phones, wearables, IoT devices, but also enterprise and government systems are where we can find huge volumes of very important data activity that DKG Edge Nodes will enable to enter the AI age in a safe and privacy-preserving way. The DKG Edge Node will enable such sensitive data to remain protected on the device, giving owners full control over how their data is shared.

Together with being protected on the device, Edge Node data becomes a part of the global DKG with precise access management permissions controlled by the data owner. In this way, AI applications that the owner allows data access to will be able to use it together with the public data in the DKG via decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).

Since such AI applications can also be run locally on devices directly, this enables fully privacy-preserving AI solutions aimed at the ever-growing number of devices on the network edge that can at the same time use both public and private DKG data. The introduction of the DKG Edge Node enables the DKG to quickly expand to be the largest, Internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN).

To unlock these powerful capabilities, DKG Edge Node will include new features that have previously not been available on DKG nodes but were elements of other proprietary or open-source products. To enable a seamless creation of knowledge, DKG nodes will inherit the proven knowledge publishing pipelines from the Network Operating System (nOS). The data protection techniques for private and sensitive data will be based on the NGI-funded OpenPKG project outcomes. The DKG Node will support all major standards such as GS1 Digital Link, EPCIS, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identities. To support the growing field of knowledge graph implementations globally, it will enable seamless knowledge graph integrations of major knowledge graph providers such as Ontotext, Oracle, Snowflake, Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and others.

To launch the DKG V8 in the best way, the core developers have launched an [**incentivised testnet program**](v8-incentivised-testnet-measure-manage-master/) **to which anyone can contribute and get rewarded in TRAC tokens.** Continue to the next page to learn more.



### What are the new capabilities in DKG V8?

Some of the new features and products in the DKG V8 include:

* **DKG Edge Nodes:** expanding the #DePIN capabilities of the DKG, OriginTrail V8 will enable anyone to run DKG-enabled trusted AI on their devices with **DKG Edge Nodes**, preserving privacy and opening up a plethora of new capabilities for builders. Your devices will participate in the global knowledge marketplace through DKG nodes on your devices, monetizing your knowledge for you, under your control, in the way you decide. Edge Nodes (formerly called "light" nodes) are capable of running your trusted AI agents, contributing to network capacity, robustness, and shared knowledge.
* **Random sampling proof system:** through this upgraded proof system, we expect at least a 100x order of magnitude scalability improvement compared to V6 across all blockchains. Random sampling is an optimistic proof system that enables growing the DKG without growing the transaction volume on blockchains, as random sampling has time-constant efficiency on the blockchain layer. Details to be published in a more comprehensive RFC.
* **Knowledge Assets V2:** introducing batch minting (creating multiple Knowledge Assets in one transaction), together with improved network resolution, Knowledge Asset I/O operations will become both faster and much less gas intensive on chain.
