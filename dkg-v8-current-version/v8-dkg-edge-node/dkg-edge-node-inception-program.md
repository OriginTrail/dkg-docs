Are you building a next generation Artificial Intelligence product, and excited about hybrid, neuro-symbolic AI?

The **DKG Edge Node inception program** is designed for builders of neuro-symbolic, privacy-enabled AI on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph with the DKG Edge Nodes and Paranets.

The Inception program provides a pool of **750k TRAC tokens** for teams launching their paranets with  DKG Edge nodes on both the DKG V6 or V8 Mainnet, with tokens exclusively used to publish Knowledge Assets to their paranets.

Ready to apply? Here's a clear roadmap to help you get started:

* **Step 1**: Explore and prototype locally
  * **Begin** by thoroughly **reading** the [DKG Edge Node documentation](dkg-edge-node-architecture.md), which will provide you with understanding of key concepts such as Knowledge Assets, paranets and the role of Edge Nodes within the DKG ecosystem.
  * **Install** the DKG Edge Node services on your local machine following [the local setup guide](setup-a-boilerplate-v8-edge-node.md).
  * **Experiment** with the node by publishing Knowledge Assets locally and trying out the different Knowledge Mining and dRAG pipelines.
* **Step 2:** Build your MVP on the testnet
  * **Define** a high-level concept for your AI service/application which you want to build a paranet around.
  * **Transition** from your local development to the DKG testnet by [deploying a testnet node](../v8-dkg-core-node/run-a-v8-core-node-on-testnet/) and integrate it in your Edge Node environment.
  * **Build** an MVP of your paranet AI service(s) - it should showcase how your team utilizes the DKG's capabilities to power the AI application.
  * **Share** the MVP with the OriginTrail community on the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QctFuPCMew) #builders-hub channel and get feedback.
* **Step 3**: Launch on mainnet
  * **Migrate** your paranet services from the DKG Testnet to the DKG Mainnet - this includes reconfiguring your Edge Node to operate on your mainnet node and creating a mainnet paranet.
  * Optionally,  **launch** your [Initial Paranet Offering (IPO)](../../dkg-v6-previous-version/autonomous-ai-paranets/launching-your-ipo.md).
  * **Continue building**, create Knowledge Assets and scale your paranet services as the paranet operator!
* **Step 4 (optional):** Apply for the DKG Edge node inception program
  * **Apply** to the inception program [via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOoyoBFC7oEftK67Sioo32Yf1YHHONME4_c8j-34IxwpBgHg/viewform).
  * If accepted, **receive** mainnet TRAC tokens which are a reimbursement for the TRAC you spent for creating Knowledge Assets on the mainnet.

Keep in mind that the applications require a demonstrable working product on the DKG mainnet.

You can apply to the inception program after completing **step 3** [via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOoyoBFC7oEftK67Sioo32Yf1YHHONME4_c8j-34IxwpBgHg/viewform).
