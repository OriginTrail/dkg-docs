# V8 DKG SDK

The OriginTrail SDKs are client libraries for your applications, used to interact and connect with the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

From an architectural standpoint, the SDK libraries are application interfaces into the DKG, enabling you to create and manage **Knowledge Assets** through your apps, as well as perform network queries (such as search, or SPARQL queries), as illustrated below.&#x20;

The OriginTrail SDK currently comes in two forms - the Javascript SDK - [**dkg.js**](dkg-v8-js-client/) and Python SDK [**dkg.py**](dkg-v8-py-client/)**.** SDKs for other programming languages would be welcome contributions to the project, and are in considerations for the roadmap by core development team as well.
