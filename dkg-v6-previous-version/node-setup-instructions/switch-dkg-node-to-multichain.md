# ðŸ”— Switch DKG node to multichain

Welcome to the guide on expanding the capabilities of your existing OriginTrail DKG node! By following these instructions, you'll seamlessly transition from a single-chain setup to a powerful multichain configuration, connecting your node not only to the NeuroWeb, but also to the other blockchain such as Gnosis or Chiado, depending on which environment your node is currently deployed (mainnet or testnet).

Before diving into the integration process, ensure you have DKG node fully operational and connected to at least 1 of the currently supported blockchains.

## OriginTrail node multichain support

At the current stage, the following multichain integrations are available for the OriginTrail DKG node:

* NeuroWeb mainnet
* NeuroWeb testnet
* Gnosis
* Chiado (Gnosis testnet)
* Base
* Base Sepolia (Base testnet)
