# Command Executor

### Introduction

The Command Executor is a component of the ot-node implementation which uses an approach similar to the event sourcing pattern. Essentially it allows developers to organize functionalities (code) in "commands" which can be executed in sequence to implement the protocol features, as well as enable system recovery in case of the node stopping or restarting for some reason.

### Commands

The Command Executor splits business logic into **commands**. A command is a general abstraction with many features that can be enabled. The Command interface is described in the table below.

| **Method**                                                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| async handleError(operationId, errorMessage, errorName, markFailed) | Error handler for command.

Table 1.1 Command interface

Creating a command is done by extending this abstract class called simply **Command**, meaning it inherits the default behaviour of all the methods and can override them with specific behaviour.

The core command method is the **execute** method. This method executes the code of the command and returns one of the three results:

* **this.continueSequence(data,sequence,opts)** - A list of commands taken from the execution context that will be executed after the current command is finished successfully.&#x20;
  * Returns **Command.empty()** if the current command is the last one in the sequence.&#x20;
* **Command.repeat()** - Command object with the **repeat** flag set to **true.** That means that the command will be executed once again.
* **Command.retry()** - Command object with the **retry** flag set to **true**. That means that the command will be executed again and the retried counter will be decreased.

Command data describes everything that is related to the specific command. This is described in the table below.

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                                                                                                    |

Table 1.2 Command data parameters

### Command Executor and dependency injection

Command executor is initialized on ot-node start. Commands are stored in the **\*/src/commands** directory. Commands will be injected into [Awilix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/awilix) automatically. The naming convention of the command is in camel case and the name of the file where the command is described by using slashes(kebab case). In the following chapter we will create a simple command called `PublishStartedCommand`.&#x20;

#### PublishStartedCommand

Letâ€™s create a simple `PublishStartedCommand` and call it in`handleHttpApiPublishRequest` controller method that handles the asset publishing request.

{% code title="publish-started-command.js" %}
```javascript
import Command from "./command.js";

class PublishStartedCommand extends Command {
    constructor(ctx){
        super(ctx);
}

    async execute(command){
        const {name} = command.data;
        
        this.logger.info(`Hello from ${name}`);
        return this.continueSequence(
            { ...command.data, retry: undefined, period: undefined},
            command.sequence,
            );
    }
    
    default(map) {
        const command = {
            name: 'publishStartedCommand',
            transactional: false
        }
        Object.assign(command,map);
        return command;
    }
}
export default PublishStartedCommand;
```
{% endcode %}

`PublishStartedCommand` will be called before the passed assertion is validated and propagated to the network. &#x20;

```javascript
async handleHttpApiPublishRequest(req, res) {
    try{
        /**
        Code responsible for creating operation record and notifying the client
        that the operation started is intentionaly left out for simplicity reasons.
        
        You can see the whole implementaton here:
        https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/blob/1181ec828bba51aa7f115e30c48458352199c67b/src/controller/v1/publish-controller.js#L18
 
        **/
        const commandData = {
            ...req.body,
            name: 'publishController',
            operationId,
        };
        
        //adding the publishStartedCommand to the command sequence
        const commandSequence = [
         'publishStartedCommand',
         'validateAssertionCommand',
         'networkPublishCommand'];

        await this.commandExecutor.add({
            name: commandSequence[0],
            sequence: commandSequence.slice(1),
            delay: 0,
            period: 5000,
            retries: 3,
            data: commandData,
            transactional: false,
        });
    } catch (error) {
        /**
        ... error handling
        /**
    }
}
```

This is the simplest command that logs the **name** given in the data parameter. After this command is finished, command executor continues with the next command in the sequence,  in this case it continues with the execution of `validateAssertionCommand` and `networkPublishCommand`.&#x20;

If we want to return some new command or list of commands, the return statement will look like in this

```javascript
return {
    commands: [
        {
            name: 'someCommand',
            data: {
                param: 'value'
            },
            transactional: false
        }
    ]
}
```

In order to make this new command repetitive and add a delay for example, we would add these parameters to the command. The code snippet will look like in this

```javascript
return {
    commands: [
        {
            name: 'someCommand',
            data: {
                param: 'value'
            },
            delay: 10000,
            period: 5000,
            transactional: false
        }
    ]
}
```

### Command Executor API

Command Executor API is simple and it looks like this:

```javascript
/**
* Initialize executor
* @returns {Promise<void>}
*/
async init() {...}

/**
* Starts the command executor
* @return {Promise<void>}
*/
async start() {...}

/**
* Adds single command to queue
* @param addCommand
* @param addDelay
* @param insert
*/
async add(addCommand, addDelay = 0, insert = true) {...}

/**
* Replays pending commands from the database
* @returns {Promise<void>}
*/
async replay() {...}
```

One of the key methods of the API is **add()** which is responsible for adding new commands to the array of commands for command-executor to carry out. Such a call would look like this:

```javascript
await this.commandExecutor.add({
    name: 'nameOfTheCommand',
    delay:45000,
    data,
    transactional: false
})
```

The **start()** command starts the executor and all the repetitive commands listed in the **constants.PERMANENT\_COMMANDS**. Those commands will be executed permanently throughout the node execution.
