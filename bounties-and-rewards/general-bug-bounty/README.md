### Important restrictions

Please ensure you do not harm any live contracts on public networks while testing; otherwise, you will not be eligible for a bug bounty.

Leaking any vulnerability of the smart contracts on social media platforms or public channels will result in the cancellation of the bounty and might also invite legal action.

### Legal notice

We cannot issue rewards to individuals on sanctions lists or who reside in countries on sanctions lists. Depending on your country of residency and citizenship, you are responsible for any tax implications. Your local law may also impose additional restrictions.

This is a discretionary rewards program. We can cancel the program at any time, and the decision to pay a reward is entirely at Trace Labs' discretion.

Your testing must not violate any law or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To avoid potential conflicts of interest, we will not grant rewards to Trace Labs employees, employees who have left Trace Labs within the last 2 years, and contractors.&#x20;
