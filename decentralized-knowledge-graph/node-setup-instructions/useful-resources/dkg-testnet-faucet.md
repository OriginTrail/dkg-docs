# DKG Testnet faucet

OriginTrail DKG v6 testnet nodes operate on the NeuroWeb testnet and Gnosis Chiado, and therefore operate with test tokens. For a node to be operational, it requires TRAC and OTP test tokens for OTP testnet or Gnosis Chiado for Gnosis testnet blockchains.

In order to get your test tokens, first join our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FCgYk2S).

Once you've joined our server, enter the **#discord-bot** channel.\
