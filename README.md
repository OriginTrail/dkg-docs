### Build verifiable Internet for AI

> _“Q. **How do you propose to do this?**_
>
> _A. **By saving the knowledge of the race**. The sum of human knowing is beyond any one man; any thousand men. With the destruction of our social fabric, science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will know much of the exceedingly tiny facets of which there is to know. They will be helpless and useless by themselves. The bits of lore, meaningless, will not be passed on. They will be lost through the generations. **But, if we now prepare a giant summary of all knowledge, it will never be lost**. Coming generations will build on it, and will not have to rediscover it for themselves. One millennium will do the work of thirty thousand.”_
>
> Hari Seldon, **Foundation series by Isaac Asimov (1951)**

**OriginTrail** is an ecosystem working toward a **verifiable Internet for artificial intelligence (AI)**—an Internet where information is trustworthy, easy to check, and keeps humans in the loop. It aims to achieve this by organizing all human knowledge in a **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)**, enabling a **collective neuro-symbolic AI.** &#x20;

A collective neuro-symbolic AI combines structured and connected information from symbolic AI (DKG) with the creativity of neural AI technologies (LLMs), building a **robust decentralized AI infrastructure.**&#x20;

This provides a powerful substrate for **trusted, human-centric AI solutions** to tackle some of humanity's most pressing challenges. It also **drives AI agents’ autonomous memories and trusted intents**, as both AI agents and robots become potent enough to act on behalf of humans.&#x20;
