# Available networks (testnets, mainnet)

### DKG Mainnet

The OriginTrail ecosystem is centered around the **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)**, which is the main network with the full protocol implementation, launched in December 2018. In March 2021 the DKG has become a multichain network, expanding its consensus layer to the xDAI blockchain, enabling the users to choose which network to utilize based on their requirements. In December 2022, DKG version 6 is launched and it is connected to OriginTrail NeuroWeb main network secured by the Polkadot Relay Chain.

### DKG Testnet

DKG Testnet runs the same implementation as the DKG Mainnet, and it is used for final release testing prior to hitting mainnet. Testnet is connected to OriginTrail NeuroWeb Testnet which is secured by Rococo Relay Chain.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to play around and test out the DKG, we recommend using the DKG Testnet. For that, you will need test TRAC and test NEURO tokens, which you can obtain by joining [our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FCgYk2S) and [requesting it from our discord bot](../dkg-v6-previous-version/node-setup-instructions/useful-resources/dkg-testnet-faucet.md).

You can also run a local network on your machine. To run a local network, please refer to the [Local network setup page](../dkg-v6-previous-version/dkg-sdk/setting-up-your-development-environment.md)
