# Deploy your Edge Node based project

## Choose Your Deployment Method

You can deploy the Edge Node using the Automated Installer (more methods coming soon):

* **Automated Installer:** A flexible and customizable setup process suitable for users comfortable with command-line tools and server environments. You will need to configure the `.env` file and use the terminal to execute the installation.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**The following instructions are intended for users who have already developed their Edge Node solution and are ready to deploy it to a production environment (Linux server).** These guides do not cover in-depth steps such as wallet preparation, funding, or configuration.
{% endhint %}

Choose the method that best fits your needs to continue the installation process:
