# Using the DKG with MCP

The OriginTrail **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** can be integrated with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to provide large language models (LLMs) with access to decentralized, structured, and verifiable knowledge.

This integration enables applications that use MCP to:

* Query the DKG using SPARQL to retrieve semantically rich data
* Generate and publish Knowledge Assets to the DKG from natural language using JSON-LD
* Store and retrieve decentralized agent memory in a standardized, interoperable way

### What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that defines how AI applications provide and receive context from data sources and tools. Think of MCP as a "USB-C" for LLMs â€” it allows LLMs to plug into external tools and structured data environments in a standardized, interoperable way.

MCP uses a client-server architecture:

* **MCP Servers** expose tools and data from local or remote environments
* **MCP Clients** (like Claude Desktop or custom IDEs) call those tools using a standard protocol

This makes it easy to build and scale AI workflows across systems without tightly coupling to any single provider or infrastructure.

### How does the DKG work with MCP?

By registering the DKG as a tool provider in an MCP server, you can:

* **Query knowledge** using tools like `query_dkg_by_name`, which execute SPARQL queries over the DKG
* **Publish knowledge** from unstructured text using tools like `create_knowledge_asset`, which turn LLM-generated content into structured JSON-LD and publish it to the DKG
* Expand the tools above and add additional tools to interact with the DKG (e.g. creating Knowledge Assets from websites or documents)

This allows agents using MCP-compatible clients to:

* Interact with real-time, decentralized knowledge
* Add to the shared memory layer used by other agents
* Benefit from data provenance, versioning, and ownership built into the DKG

### Why is this powerful?

MCP makes it easy to build modular, agent-based systems where LLMs use tools to:

* Ask questions against the Decentralized Knowledge Graph
* Write and revise their own memory as JSON-LD Knowledge Assets
* Store results and publish new discoveries collaboratively

When paired with the DKG, this gives LLM-based systems access to a decentralized knowledge base that is:

* **Interoperable** (via RDF and schema.org)
* **Trustworthy** (anchored with cryptographic proofs)
* **Queryable** (via SPARQL and linked data tooling)

To get started:

* Explore the [dkg-mcp-server example repo ](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-mcp-server)
* Try integrating the DKG into your MCP server
* Build agents that reason over, expand, and query the decentralized web of knowledge
