# Introduction

While other sections introduce the high-level capabilities of the DKG, this section is for those who want to understand whatâ€™s really happening behind the scenes: how data flows through the system, how nodes coordinate, how cryptographic proofs work, and how the DKG achieves verifiability, decentralization, and semantic interoperability at scale.

#### What You'll Learn in the Following Pages:

* The mechanics of delegated staking
* How data is structured and hashed using Merkle roots
* The mechanics of publishing, replication, and querying across Core and Edge Nodes
* How consensus protocols tie into graph storage and knowledge lifecycle via Random Sampling
* How DKG Sync works and why it is needed, etc

Whether you're building dapps, deploying nodes, or integrating symbolic AI agents, this section will give you a technical foundation to architect on top of the DKG with confidence.
