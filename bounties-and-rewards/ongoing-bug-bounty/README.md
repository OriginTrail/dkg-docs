### Important restrictions

Please ensure that while doing testing you are not harming any live contracts on public networks, otherwise you will not be eligible for bug bounty.

Leaking any vulnerability of the smart contracts on any social media platforms or public channels will lead to cancellation of Bounty and might also invite legal action.

### Legal notice

We cannot issue rewards to individuals on sanctions lists, or who are in countries on sanctions lists. You are responsible for any tax implications depending on your country of residency and citizenship. There may be additional restrictions depending upon your local law.

This is a discretionary rewards program. We can cancel the program at any time, and the decision to pay a reward is entirely at Trace Labs discretion.

Your testing must not violate any law, or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own.
